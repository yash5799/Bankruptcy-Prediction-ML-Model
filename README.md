# Bankruptcy-Prediction-ML-Model
# Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning  This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based model to predict bankruptcy of companies using financial indicators. 


---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution and structure.
- Apply **feature engineering** and **scaling** techniques.
- Build and tune models using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost Classifiers**.
- Evaluate models using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.
- Use **K-Fold Cross Validation** and **GridSearchCV** for model optimization.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Dataset Source

- Dataset: Taiwan Economic Journal (1999–2009)
- Features: 95 Financial Ratios
- Target: `Bankrupt?` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Precision Score
- Recall Score
- F1 Score
- K-Fold Cross Validation

---

## 📈 Results

- **Random Forest Accuracy:** ~X.XX%
- **XGBoost Accuracy:** ~X.XX%
> (Replace with actual results after training)

---

## 🔍 EDA Insights

- Highly imbalanced dataset (~3% bankrupt companies)
- Some features exhibit multicollinearity
- Log transformations and normalization helped improve model stability

---

## 📎 Future Work

- Implement feature importance ranking
- Apply SMOTE or other sampling techniques to address imbalance
- Deploy the model via Flask or Streamlit
